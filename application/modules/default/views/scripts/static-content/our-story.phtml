      <p><?php echo $this->translate("It was a dark and stormy night…..sorry, couldn't resist that one….actually it wasn't, it was just a night like any other.  But for some reason I bolted awake at 4 am after having a dream that was so realistic and detailed, it woke me from a sound sleep.  I dreamed of a web site that would allow horse owners like me to keep track of all of the information that we all typically keep on little bits of paper, in notebooks, on white boards or for the most organized among us, in file folders organized by horse.  But even those files are full of all sorts of different types of information that you have to sort through to find the right vet receipt or training log or purchase record that you need.")?>
 <p><?php echo $this->translate("Ok, back to the dream….when I woke up, I got up and wrote the idea down thinking it probably wouldn't make much sense in the light of day. But lo and behold, when I awoke to read it the next morning, it still seemed like a darn good idea!  So from that moment, I set about creating the site of my dreams – One Source Horse!  Now with the help and support of some of my very best fellow horse enthusiasts, we have created One Source Horse so that you too can document, store and track all of the most important…and even not so important details of your horse's life.  We want the site to first be useful and easy to use (after all, horse people want to be doing things with their horses, not trying to figure out web sites); interesting - full of clever and helpful information that will help you manage your horses day to day; and especially full of input from our users.  OSH will be a vehicle for you to share your ideas and great equine moments with your friends, trainers and other OSH contacts.  And we want to hear from you with your suggestions on how to make our site the best, FREE, equine management site in the industry!  Welcome, and strap on your helmet, it is going to be a wild and wonderful ride!");?></p>
